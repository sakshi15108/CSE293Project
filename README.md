**Project details:**

Algorithm implemented: 
  ``ZUC-128``

``ZUC`` is a word-oriented stream cipher. It takes a 128-bit initial key and a 128-bit initial vector (IV) as input, and outputs a keystream of 32-bit words (where each 32-bit word is hence called a key-word). This keystream can be used for encryption/decryption.

The execution of ZUC has two stages: initialization stage and working stage. In the first stage, a key/IV initialization is performed, i.e., the cipher is clocked without producing output. The second stage is a working stage. In this stage, with every clock pulse, it produces a 32-bit word of output.
